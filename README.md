# CrOS
**The Czech Retarded OS**

So? What is this all about. It's little operating system, like school project. Its try and error. So
probably don't try this at home. Or you will accidently learn ASM :)

Its not any ultra big project, it's family friendly project.
If you find any mistakes or bugs, you can help shape this project, as I am in progress of learning.
So best luck!


If you didn't noticed yet. This is software made by Czech developer (with big help of friends).
